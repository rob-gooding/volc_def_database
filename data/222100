The deformation is episodic. An episode of surface deformation was only oberseverd from 2004-2006. Surface deformation was subsidence of 4.6cm. Best fitting source model for each episode of subsidence is inflation or deflation of a penny-sized crack at a depth 2-5Km. 
Observed transient uplift and subsidence of a second, nearby source is likely associated with the the complex plumbing system under the observed volcanos. The penny-sized crack is at 4.1 and at a radius of 6.2Km. The deformation could also be explained by a Mogi source (point source).
